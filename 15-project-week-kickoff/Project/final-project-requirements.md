# Final Project Requirements and Rules

## Grading
Your grade is based on your individual effort and your project's technical merit.
* Individual effort is graded based on **links to commits and Pull Requests** that demonstrate your contributions.
* Group technical merit is graded based on the following criteria:
 * **Obvious MVC/REST architecture**
    * Single-page app style
    * Clearly defined Resources in the app
    * Resource data is persisted by a database, with an API (server) to access that data
    * Resources have well-factored and isolated M, V, C components
    * URLs use conventional REST design
 * **Good and proper use of HTML**
    * Clear, readable, and efficient structure
    * Uses semantic markup whenever possible
 * **Good and proper use of CSS**
    * Clear, readable, and efficient styles
    * Layout works on various screen sizes like desktop and mobile
    * Layout uses a mobile-first approach
    * Well organized file structure, using SMACSS.
 * **Good and proper use of JavaScript**
    * Clear, readable, and efficient code
    * Uses domain models to encapsulate data and behavior (OOP)
    * Responds to user events
    * Leverages AJAX appropriately in at least one case
    * Integrates 3rd party libraries like jQuery consistently
    * Contains no unnecessary or commented-out code
 * **Generally useful and functional, with sufficient scope**
    * Works as expected with no bugs
    * Has at least 3 interlinked "pages" (a.k.a. views) with a clear navigation
        * One of these views must be an About Us view describing the team members
        * At least two views must accept and process user input
    * Uses the following data models, at minimum:
        * Data from an external API and at least one data model stored in your database. The external API may be accessed client-side, if no authentication is required, or server-side. Data from this external API may be cached in the database if that external API permits it.
        * OR
        * No data from an external API, and at least three data models (with at least one join) stored in your database.
    * State is persisted between page reloads
    * Deployed live on the Internet using Heroku. The application must have a meaningfully-named URL, either through a custom-named Heroku application or, ideally, through purchasing and connecting a domain (as of April 2017, Namecheap.com offers a wide variety of domain names for $0.88).

**Rules**

Here's the process that we'll be using for project week.
1. On the first day of project week your team must submit a proposal to the instructional staff.
2. During project week, your team must work on-campus during lab time (9am - 6pm) so we can help whenever your team is stuck. This is not a week to leave early or arrive late. You will likely end up doing work in the evenings after lab time, either with your team on campus, or researching/planning/writing code at home. If you write code at home in the evenings, make sure that it is a.) tied to an issue your team has created, and b.) that your team knows you're working on it.
3. Each day, we will conduct morning and afternoon standups. Your entire team must be present for standup. Morning standups begin at 9:30am, and afternoon standups begin at 3:30 pm.
4. On the last day of project week, your team must present your project in front of the class.
